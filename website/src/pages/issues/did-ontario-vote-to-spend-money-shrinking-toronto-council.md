    On Friday July 27th the Ontario PC government led by Doug Ford made it clear
    that shrinking Toronto&rsquo;s city council was a top priority. The government
    made two major arguments:

  <ul>
    <li>Shrinking council will save $25,500,000.00 <em>

    </li>
    <li>Shrinking Council will improve decision making</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There are a number of problems with this plan.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Cities like Los Angeles, New York, and London England are often cited
      as having smaller councils. This argument is dishonest as those cities have

  <p>
    Based on simple calculations and the government&rsquo;s current plans 
    it seems like slashing council in such a rushed manner will cost Ontarians.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do people in places like Sudbury, Thunder Bay, London, or Ottawa really need
    to pay for what seems like the premier&rsquo;s personally motivated revenge?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>No.</strong> Ontarians deserve better. Both Christine Elliott and Caroline
    Mulroney would not likely have rushed into such a decision.

  <p>
    Please reach out to your MPP &mdash; especially if they&rsquo;re a member of the 
    Ontario Conservative party &mdash; and ask them to select a more qualified leader.
